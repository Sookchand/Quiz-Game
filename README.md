#  Quiz Game{Python Game}
Here's a brief description of your Python quiz game:

The game consists of four Python files: `main.py`, `question_model.py`, `quiz_brain.py`, and `data.py`.

1. **`data.py`**: This file contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a question. Each dictionary has two keys: "text" (the question itself) and "answer" (the answer to the question, which is either "True" or "False").

2. **`question_model.py`**: This file defines a class called `Question`. The `Question` class has an initializer method that takes two parameters: `text` and `answer`. These parameters are used to set the `text` and `answer` attributes of a `Question` object.

3. **`quiz_brain.py`**: This file defines a class called `QuizBrain`. The `QuizBrain` class has several methods:
   - An initializer method that takes a list of questions and initializes the `question_number`, `score`, and `question_list` attributes.
   - A method called `still_has_questions()` that checks if there are still questions left in the quiz.
   - A method called `next_question()` that displays the next question to the user and checks their answer.
   - A method called `check_answer()` that checks if the user's answer is correct, updates the score if it is, and provides feedback to the user.

4. **`main.py`**: This is the main script that runs the game. It imports the necessary classes and data, creates a list of `Question` objects based on the data, creates a `QuizBrain` object with this list of questions, and then runs the quiz by repeatedly calling the `next_question()` method until there are no more questions left. Finally, it prints out the user's final score.

The game is a simple True/False quiz where users are asked questions and must respond with either "True" or "False". Their score is tracked throughout the game, and their final score is displayed at the end. The game continues until all questions have been asked.

## Tech Stack
The quiz game is built using Python, which is a high-level, interpreted programming language. Python is known for its simplicity and readability, which makes it a great choice for beginners as well as experienced developers.

The game uses basic Python concepts such as:
- **Classes and Objects**: The `Question` and `QuizBrain` classes are defined with their respective attributes and methods. Instances of these classes are created in the main script.
- **Loops**: A while loop is used in the main script to keep asking questions until there are none left.
- **Conditionals**: If-else statements are used to check the user's answers and update the score accordingly.
- **Lists**: A list is used to store all the question objects.
- **Dictionaries**: Each question and its answer are stored as a dictionary in the `data.py` file.

No other technologies or libraries were used in this game. It's a simple console-based game that runs on pure Python. It doesn't have a graphical user interface, so it runs in the terminal or command prompt. The user interacts with the game by typing their answers into the console. The game then prints out the next question or the final score, depending on whether there are any questions left.
## Documentation
Sure, here are the official Python documentation for the technologies you used in your quiz game:

1. **Python**: General Python documentation can be found at [Python.org](^1^) or [Python 3.12.0 documentation](^2^).

2. **Classes and Objects**: Documentation on Python classes and objects can be found in the [Python 3.12.0 documentation](^4^) and at [W3Schools](^6^).

3. **Loops**: Documentation on Python loops can be found in the [Python 3.12.0 documentation](^10^) and at [Codecademy](^12^).

4. **Conditionals**: Documentation on Python conditionals can be found in the [Python 3.12.0 documentation](^10^) and at [freeCodeCamp.org](^15^).

5. **Lists**: Documentation on Python lists can be found in the [Python 3.12.0 documentation](^18^) and at [Google for Developers](^19^).

6. **Dictionaries**: Documentation on Python dictionaries can be found in the [Python 3.12.0 documentation](^18^) and at [Real Python](^22^).

These resources should provide comprehensive information about these Python concepts.
